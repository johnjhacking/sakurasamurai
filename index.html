&gt; Sakura Samurai 桜の侍
======================

Was founded on December 31st, 2020 as a one of a kind hacking group. In Japanese
Culture, Sakura means "Cherry Blossom" and is the symbol of rebirth. The
creation of this group is the rebirth of hacking culture.

Long are the days since Hacking is regarded as a criminal activity. Sakura
Samurai believe in Honor, Trust, Community, and Responsibility.

Anyone can represent the ideals that Sakura Samurai stand for, but not everyone
can be part of our group. 

Lead as I lead, step as I step, but none of us will walk the same path.

<div class="header">-----BEGIN MEMBERS LIST-----</div>

&gt; Buzzkill バズ殺す (John Jackson @johnjhacking)
==============================================
Jackson was given the nickname Buzzkill as a child, partly in jest. The nickname was meant to represent his nature of pointing out the possible negative outcomes of decisions, which his friends could not stand. Many times, "Killing the Buzz" was what the group needed. Buzzkill became the word that in modern day research represents his incandescent persistent to convince Enterprises to fix vulnerabilities. Observant, Sharp-witted, and dedicated - his passion for research has brought him closer to some of the most talented hackers in the world.  

&gt; Arctic 北極
============

Arctic earned his nickname due to his icy cold demeanor. Able to withstand even the most rigorous of temperatures, Arctic is the last sole-survior of the original group in which the call signs were earned. Machine Learning Engineer by day, security researcher by night, Arctic believes that the role of hacking is to make the world a better place.

&gt; ShÄde シェード (Ali Diamond @endingwithali)
===========================================

In literature and poetry, a shade is the spirit or ghost of a dead person, residing in the underworld. In definition, shade takes the form of a shelter from light, shadows that gather in the darkness, or a subtle, sneering expression of contempt or disqust for someone or something. Make no mistake, Ali earned the nickname ShÄde not out of malice - but due to her highly intellectual observations, throwing shade in such a way that's  both funny and educational. In addition, like shade, Ali is the cool-spot from the sun - a much needed darkness. As a Software Engineer she's developed and open sourced many tools, and undoubtedly will become an expert in the art of exploitation.

&gt; Kanshi 監視 (Jackson Henry @JacksonHHax)
=========================================

Henry earned the nickname "Kanshi" due to his love for reconnaissance. The word Kanshi in Japanese means many things: depending on context it can mean surveillance, observation or inspection. Quick on his feet, he is an expert at the information gathering stage of security research, many times leading to severe vulnerabilities without any additional exploitation required. Henry is the youngest member of the team - joining Sakura Samurai at 15 years old.

&gt; Rejex 正規表現 (Robert Willis @rej_ex)
======================================

Short for Regular Expression, Rejex is a play on the acronym RegEx. Willis earned the name Rejex due to his elite RegEx crafting abilities. A refined warrior in the Offensive Security field, Willis has rolled lone-wolf for awhile - but has joined the ranks of Sakura Samurai to contribute to the greater good of enterprise security. An artist in both physical art and the art of hacking, he is an expert with a well-sharpened blade. 

&gt; Kirtaner キルタナー (Aubrey Cottle @Kirtaner)
======================================
Kirtaner has been steeped in the scene and culture since before he was in grade school. Given his own dialup modem and dedicated phone line at the age of 7, the Internet would eventually never be the same again. Kirtaner earned his nickname because he spent an awful amount of time buying garbage from 'Wirt' in Diablo I. The ultimate all-rounder and capable of absorbing new skills at an astonishing pace. The Founder of Anonymous; occasionally dabbling in the art of Ethical Research and Disclosure, but nonetheless - He is legion.
